implement:
- save high scores
- game set up and start jingle
- choosing which way to go when leaving the ghost house (based on mode changes?)
- title screen with tutorial animations
- cutscene animations (actual scenes!)

fix:
- WAY TOO MANY PASS-THROUGHS
- pinky going wrong way at spawn?
- if power pellet is last dot eaten, ghosts should turn blue but freeze and no sound
- ghosts sometimes go through walls for some reason
- positions jank up when resizing window
- pac dot audio jank (how does he actually eat them??)
- blue ghosts sometimes pass through walls upon turning blue
- holding up at start of game gets pac man stuck (happens sometimes but not all the time)

nitpicks:
- should clyde have a circular detection range or a diamond?
- should the siren play at the same time as the retreat sound?
- where is the bottom of the ghost house?
- Blue ghosts choose a direction randomly, then clockwise until valid (who cares lol)
- PRNG is reset with same initial seed
- ghosts continually animated their bottom halfs all the time
- ghost/pac/eyes/fruit drawing priority
- slight audio reverb
- During flash:
- alternate blue / white 14 frames each
- FINAL FLASH IS 11
- so timer for flashing equals:
(FLASHNUMBER - 1)*(14/60) + (11/60)
