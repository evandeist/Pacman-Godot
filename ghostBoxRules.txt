Pinky dot limit is always 0, (as is blinky's technically, but he never waits)

first level:
pinky leaves,
inky waits for 30 dots to be eaten
clyde waits for 60 more dots to be eaten

second level:
pinky 0
inky 0
clyde 50

third level:
all 0

ON LIFE LOST:
each ghost's dot counter is disabled but not reset
global counter used instead

pinky - global counter is 7
inky - global counter is 17
clyde - global counter is 32
if clyde is in the house and global is 32, global is reset to 0 and deactivated and personal counters are re-activated

ADDITIONALLY:
timer for last time a dot was eaten
once timer timesout, next ghost leaves, timer resets

stage 1-4:
timer = 4 seconds
stage 5:
timer = 3 seconds
